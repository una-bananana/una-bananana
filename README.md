## 👋 Hi, I’m Ana

I’m a data-oriented problem solver with a background that blends analytics, business understanding, and real-world operations. I enjoy working with data to uncover insights, improve decision-making, and build practical solutions that actually get used.

My experience includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and building machine learning models, as well as communicating results clearly to non-technical audiences. I’m especially interested in projects where data supports business strategy, pricing, forecasting, or optimization.

**🤝 Open to Outsourcing & Collaborative Projects**

I’m currently interested in participating in outsourcing projects, freelance work, and collaborative data projects.
I enjoy working with international teams and adapting to different business needs, timelines, and technical stacks.

-Can quickly understand your data and business context
-Communicates clearly and documents their work

I’d love to connect.
